# Admin API And Spec Rules

## Admin API Invariants

- Admin API validates JWTs but never mints them. Operators pre-sign tokens externally.
- DB and CP modes require `FERRUM_ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` of at least 32 chars because their admin APIs are writable.
- File and DP admin surfaces are read-only where configured and must reject writes.
- Observability surfaces are tiered (`MetricsAuthPolicy` + `observability_detail_allowed` in `src/admin/mod.rs`): `/live` is always unauthenticated and returns only `{"status":"ok"}`; `/health`+`/status` return `status`+`ready` unauthenticated and full diagnostics only when authenticated; `/overload` returns coarse `{level}` unauthenticated and the full snapshot only when authenticated; `/metrics` returns `401` unless authenticated. "Authenticated" = valid admin JWT OR matching `FERRUM_METRICS_BEARER_TOKEN` OR a `FERRUM_METRICS_ALLOWED_CIDRS` source IP. Do not regress these to unauthenticated detail.
- `/health` (and `/overload`) still respond unauthenticated so liveness/LB probes work; the DB check remains cached 15s via `AdminState.CachedDbHealthResult` so unauthenticated probes cannot flood the pool. Refreshes are single-flight (`AdminState.db_health_refresh` + `cached_db_health_connected`) with a 5s probe timeout: at most one DB health query runs per refresh window while cache hits stay lock-free.
- `/health` response includes `database.pool` stats when connected, but only in the authenticated (detailed) tier.
- `/metrics/runtime` remains JWT-authenticated and cached through `runtime_metrics_cache()`.
- `GET /cluster` is JWT-authenticated. CP returns connected DPs from `DpNodeRegistry`; DP returns CP connection state including primary/fallback and `last_config_received_at`.
- `GET /backend-capabilities` and `POST /backend-capabilities/refresh` are JWT-authenticated and expose only classifications plus probe timestamps.

## OpenAPI Parity

- Admin request/response changes, new endpoints, new fields, new status codes, and any new plugin schema must update `openapi.yaml`.
- UI integrations consume `openapi.yaml`; spec drift silently breaks downstream tooling.
- Keep docs under `docs/admin*.md` aligned with endpoint behavior.

## API Spec Management

- API specs are admin-only metadata. They must never be loaded by gateway runtime.
- Supported submissions are OpenAPI 2.0 and 3.0.x/3.1.x/3.2.x JSON or YAML.
- `x-ferrum-proxy` is required. `x-ferrum-upstream` and `x-ferrum-plugins` are supported extensions.
- Endpoints: `POST/PUT/GET/DELETE /api-specs[/{id}]`, `GET /api-specs/by-proxy/{proxy_id}`, and `GET /api-specs`.
- DB and CP modes are read/write for specs. DP and file mode reject spec endpoints.
- Original specs are gzip-compressed and stored with sha256/resource hash metadata.

## Hot-Path Guards

- Do not add `ApiSpec` to `GatewayConfig`.
- Do not add API spec blobs to `src/config/db_loader.rs` load/poll paths.
- Do not add API specs to `src/grpc/cp_server.rs` broadcasts. DPs never receive specs.
- Do not add API specs to periodic refresh, runtime snapshots, `ArcSwap`, or caches.
- Integration guard: `tests/integration/admin_db_api_specs_tests.rs`.

## Extraction And Validation

- Spec-extracted resources must use the same admission path as direct admin POSTs.
- Reuse `Proxy::normalize_fields()`, `validate_fields()`, `plugins::validate_plugin_config()`, and uniqueness checks.
- Do not fork validation logic for specs.
- Main entrypoint is `extract_and_validate()` in `src/admin/api_specs/handlers.rs`.
- Reject `x-ferrum-consumers`; consumers and credentials are managed through consumer endpoints.
- Reject plugin `scope != proxy` inside specs.
- Reject plugin `proxy_id` that differs from the spec proxy ID.
- Reject embedded credential keys by recursively walking the plugin `config` value. Do not reject merely because a plugin name contains `jwt`.

## Ownership And Replacement

- Nullable `api_spec_id` on proxies, upstreams, and plugin configs marks spec-owned resources.
- PUT `/api-specs/{id}` deletes resources owned by that spec and reinserts extracted resources.
- Hand-added resources with `api_spec_id NULL` survive PUT replacement.
- DELETE cascades through proxy foreign keys and manually cleans spec-owned upstreams; the upstream back-link intentionally has no FK.
- `replace_api_spec_bundle` compares `resource_hash`, excluding `api_spec_id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
- If the resource hash matches on PUT, update only the `api_specs` row. Do not advance `updated_at` on proxies/upstreams/plugin configs.
- Matching resource hash must not trigger router/plugin cache rebuild, pool warmup, capability refresh, or DP broadcast.
- When changing the hash function, update SQL `db_loader.rs` and `mongo_store.rs` together.

## Storage Caps

- Request body cap is `FERRUM_ADMIN_SPEC_MAX_BODY_SIZE_MIB`, default 25 MiB.
- MongoDB is also constrained by the 16 MB BSON document limit. Specs over about 14 MiB compressed should use SQL backends.
- MongoDB multi-document atomicity for spec replacement requires `FERRUM_MONGO_REPLICA_SET`.

## Backup, Restore, And Audit

- Restore entrypoints must normalize fields the same way as admin and loaders.
- Backup/restore changes that affect admin shapes require `openapi.yaml` and docs updates.
- Preserve audit behavior for security-sensitive admin operations.
- Validate path traversal and archive/file hostile input before reading or writing backup/spec artifacts.
