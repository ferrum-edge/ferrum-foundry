# Plugin Rules

## Model And Scopes

- Plugins have `id`, `config`, optional `priority_override`, and a priority where lower runs first.
- Scopes are `global`, `proxy`, and `proxy_group`.
- Multiple instances per proxy are allowed.
- A proxy/group-scoped plugin replaces a same-named global for that proxy.
- Multiple scoped instances of the same type may coexist.
- Exception: `api_chargeback` admits at most one effective instance per proxy
  after merge (shared `/charges` registry is exactly-once) and requires every
  enabled instance to agree on the process-global render/cleanup/budget
  tunables (`max_entries` / `max_retained_bytes` included). The registry admits
  at most `max_entries` retained billing rows (complete entry keys — one
  principal can occupy many slots across proxy/status/family/currency/
  namespace/price dimensions); a refused new row folds into the
  fixed-cardinality internal overflow row
  (`__cardinality_overflow__~sha256:ferrum-edge/api-chargeback/overflow/v1`)
  rather than being dropped (per-identity attribution lost). That sentinel is
  in the digest-form identity class, so a real principal can never share its
  registry key. Authenticated `GET /charges` before the plugin is configured
  must not claim the process-global registry (empty response; later accepted
  generation sizes the hot map with its configured pool shard count).
- Billing identities are never prefix-truncated. External identity claims above
  512 bytes are rejected at the authentication boundary
  (`commit_authentication_attempt`); anything still needing a bound inside
  chargeback uses `chargeback::bounded_billing_identity` (prefix + SHA-256
  digest of the complete value; marker-bearing values always digested).
- Exception: `request_deduplication` may not be effective on the same proxy as
  `mcp_gateway`; its response rewrite comes from live upstream discovery state
  that no persisted digest can witness (`DYNAMIC_RESPONSE_PRESENTATION_PLUGINS`,
  mirrored at runtime by `ResponsePresentationPolicy::Dynamic`). The same refusal
  applies PER INSTANCE to an `a2a_gateway` whose Agent Card rewrite derives its
  public base from the request (`discovery.public_base_url` unset while
  `discovery.trust_forwarded_headers` is true): the origin then depends on
  forwarded headers and on `frontend_sni_hostname`, which the fingerprint does
  not bind (`CONDITIONALLY_DYNAMIC_RESPONSE_PRESENTATION_PLUGINS` +
  `a2a_gateway::presentation_policy_is_request_derived`). A configured
  public-base `a2a_gateway` enrolls `Static` and composes normally.
  Deduplication runs at priority 3010, after route dispatch and
  `request_transformer` header/query rules but before terminate-mode
  `serverless_function`. Plugin-cache admission rejects every same-protocol
  header/query/destination mutator at or after deduplication, including priority
  overrides,
  and rejects any deferred request-body transformer whose final bytes are not
  exactly the body produced by the pre-`before_proxy` normalization phase.
- `response_caching` likewise requires the proxy's private proof that the
  complete GET/HEAD upload is empty before lookup, binds the complete
  backend-visible request target (including the effective outbound query),
  rejects later header/query/destination mutation, and rejects deferred body
  transforms that could synthesize bytes after lookup. Configured request
  decompression remains compatible because its exact final body is published
  during pre-`before_proxy` normalization. Its request-header dimension
  conservatively binds all backend-visible headers, in addition to the complete
  `Vary` tuple, except the entry-operation headers whose semantics this plugin
  actually implements:
  `If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since` revalidation, pure honored request
  `Cache-Control: no-cache` / `no-store` refreshes (bare and argument-free, only
  when every meaningful member is such a refresh and only when
  `respect_no_cache` is enabled), and zero-length `Content-Length`
  framing — and a gateway-minted `correlation_id` header whose live value still
  matches private request provenance (issue #3929). Client-supplied correlation
  values remain origin-visible dimensions; do not globally ignore `x-request-id`
  or trust a client-spoofable metadata/header marker. A conditional
  revalidation, a pure client no-cache/no-store refresh, and `Content-Length: 0`
  are addressed to an entry rather than selecting a different one — keying the
  raw view would put each of them in a partition the entry cannot be reached
  from and make the `Vary` index unreachable.
  Unsupported precondition / range / pragma headers (`If-Match`,
  `If-Unmodified-Since`, `If-Range`, `Range`, `Pragma`), mixed / arbitrary /
  unrecognized or argument-bearing request `Cache-Control` content, and any
  `Cache-Control` when `respect_no_cache` is false stay bound so they cannot
  share a replay key.
  Cross-caller isolation is the mandatory caller partition. `Authorization`,
  `Proxy-Authorization`, and `Cookie` remain mandatory Vary names even for
  anonymous entries because downstream shared caches cannot observe Ferrum's
  private caller partition; present values are hashed and absence is a distinct
  keyed state. The RFC shared-cache authorization admission checks both pristine
  inbound and live backend-visible `Authorization`, so request transforms cannot
  erase it.
- Exception: `load_testing` admits at most one effective instance per proxy
  after merge. Both it and `api_chargeback` are enforced by
  `exclusive_effective_instance_errors` in `src/plugin_cache.rs`, applied to the
  merged per-proxy chain in both the full-build and incremental-rebuild paths.
- Stateful protections are owned by a **stable policy identity**
  (`namespace` + plugin-config id), never by the plugin instance the cache
  happened to construct and never by request-controlled data
  (GHSA-wmqm-6mxj-gm9p). `tcp_connection_throttle` live-connection accounting is
  carried in a plugin-cache-owned instance map
  (`TcpConnectionThrottleInstanceMap`); `load_testing` run admission and
  local-mode `request_deduplication` state use per-plugin weak registries
  (`SHARED_STATES`, `SHARED_LOCAL_STATES`) whose entries are pruned on insert,
  so retention is bounded by the currently configured policies plus in-flight
  holders. The six local rate limiters (`rate_limiting`, `ai_rate_limiter`,
  `graphql`, `grpc_method_router`, `ws_rate_limiting`, `udp_rate_limiting`) use
  the same weak-registry pattern inside `RateLimitBackend`
  (`SharedLocalLimiterState` / `LocalLimiterRegistry` in
  `src/plugins/utils/rate_limit.rs`, reached from `try_create_plugin` ->
  `create_local_rate_limit_plugin`, issue #4268). Their identity is
  `namespace` + plugin KIND + plugin-config id — the kind is load-bearing
  because three of them share one algorithm type — and each registry is
  statically typed per `(key, algorithm)` pair, so there is no downcast to get
  wrong. Compatibility is a SHA-256 fingerprint over the plugin's EFFECTIVE
  enforcement semantics — a `LocalStateSemantics` the constructor fills in
  AFTER its own parsing, defaulting, and normalization (limit dimension,
  window lists, algorithm parameters, plugin-specific shaping) — plus the
  shared posture. Never fingerprint raw JSON: an omitted optional field and
  its explicit effective default, a spelling the parser normalizes, and an
  omitted rate map vs an explicit empty one are the same enforcement, so
  hashing syntax would let config churn alone mint a fresh budget. The shared
  posture is `sync_mode`, and ONLY when Redis is enabled the effective
  `redis_failure_policy` and an EXPLICIT key prefix — the default prefix is
  already determined by the stable policy identity, so it is not hashed and a
  validation client's namespace cannot perturb compatibility. With
  `sync_mode: local` there is no store to lose, the posture changes nothing
  enforced, and toggling it must not reset the budget. Never record a
  credential, URL, username, password, or TLS material in
  `LocalStateSemantics` (a debug assertion refuses the shared Redis config
  keys), and never log the fingerprint. Presentation-only fields
  (`expose_headers`, `close_reason`) and stateless checks (GraphQL
  depth/complexity, gRPC allow/deny lists) are
  deliberately outside the set so they cannot reset a live budget. Sharing the
  limiter is only half of it: `DynamicHttpRateLimitAlgorithm::check_local`
  compares window VALUES, not `Arc` identity, because a compatible rebuild
  always constructs a new `DynamicRateLimitOp`. Direct/legacy test construction
  without a stable identity keeps private state. Security-composition config
  validation constructs candidates with their real identity; those candidates
  can resolve retained state but never run traffic or mutate counters. A
  compatible reload inherits live state; a semantic change isolates
  onto fresh state so a retired generation's late release/completion cannot
  corrupt the replacement. For deduplication the semantic set is deliberately
  narrow — `header_name`, `local` vs `redis`, and `on_redis_unavailable` —
  because everything else is either bound into the logical key or enforced per
  operation. In-flight operations, completions, and execution barriers retain
  their admission-time protection windows across reloads; never evaluate an
  existing lease with a replacement generation's shorter timeout. Weak
  registries keep every still-live semantic generation for an identity, not
  just the last one, so while A and B are concurrently live another A
  construction recovers A's active protection state. After A's last owner
  drops, a later A construction starts fresh. Do not reintroduce per-instance
  ownership for any of these.
- `proxy_group` is one shared instance for its associated proxies; stateful plugins share counters and are cascade-deleted when no proxies remain.

## Lifecycle Order

Preserve phase order and protocol matrix from `src/plugins/mod.rs` and `docs/plugin_execution_order.md`:

1. `on_request_received`: tracing/CORS/termination/IP+geo/bot/spec_expose/spiffe/SSE/gRPC-Web/size+rate/tx_debug
2. `authenticate`: mTLS, JWKS, JWT, keyauth, LDAP, basicauth, HMAC
3. `authorize`: ACL, mesh_authz, rate limiting
4. `normalize_buffered_request_body_before_before_proxy`: configured request decompression (and any future early body normalizers) after the pre-`before_proxy` buffer is stored
4b. `validate_client_request_body_contract`: CLIENT-contract admission over the ORIGINAL client representation, after normalization and before any `before_proxy`/`transform_request_body` hook can reshape it. Read-only (admit or reject, never rewrite). `openapi_validator` owns this phase; its `on_final_request_body` is the BACKEND-contract fallback when this validator did not select over the pristine client view but can select after a `before_proxy` route override or header/target rewrite, and is skipped per instance once the client phase decided, so one request is never charged twice (`GHSA-896v-jx23-9g6p`). Unknown-operation admission (`fail_on_unknown_operation`) is rejected in `before_proxy`, not deferred to the final fallback. HBONE CONNECT is NOT a fallback path — the proxy skips request-body buffering for it and returns into `handle_hbone_request` before any final-body hook, so tunnel bytes are never a request body here. The phase also covers the transport-proven-empty H1/H2 `GET`/`HEAD`/`OPTIONS` fast path (validated against `&[]` without materializing a buffer), so a required client body is enforced identically on H1/H2/H3. A plugin declaring `validates_client_request_body_contract()` MUST also declare `requires_request_body_before_before_proxy()`; `validate_plugin_security_composition` rejects the composition otherwise. A plugin here must select buffering from the matched route/operation, never from an attacker-omittable `Content-Type` (`GHSA-6p78-6x8c-9g9x`).
5. `before_proxy`: SOAP, AI plugins, workload metrics, transformers, mock, gRPC deadline, load, cache, compression
5b. `enforce_final_backend_header_policy`: synchronous, NON-rejecting
    re-assertion of a plugin-owned backend-boundary header set over the
    FINAL backend-visible header map (`GHSA-xhp5-hqj8-3mwg`). Runs after the
    `before_proxy` pass, after each deferred routing/remaining pass, and after a
    finalized-egress header overlay — always after the reserved gateway-assertion
    refresh and the egress baggage strip, on the H1/H2 ladder
    (`src/proxy/mod.rs`) and the native H3 ladder (`src/http3/server.rs`). Gated
    on `PluginCapabilities::ENFORCES_FINAL_BACKEND_HEADER_POLICY`. Implementations
    must be idempotent and must never log header values. `ai_stream_router` owns
    this phase: priority 2984 does not order it after `request_transformer`
    (3000), so re-asserting here is what actually keeps a client or
    normal-backend credential off the third-party provider. Its matching
    fail-closed decision (final provider-visible `model` must still equal the
    PRIVATELY committed model AND match the selected provider's
    `model_patterns`; the committed destination witness must be intact) lives in
    `on_final_request_body`, which has rejection plumbing on every dispatcher.
    A plugin declaring this capability may not be composed with
    `request_deduplication` (a before_proxy fingerprint cannot witness a later
    mutation). `response_caching` needs no added rule: it already refuses any
    deferred request-body transformer, which `ai_stream_router` is.
    Headers are not the whole boundary. `ai_stream_router` records a PRIVATE
    typed claim (`RequestContext::ai_stream_router_claim`) — never metadata,
    never logged — carrying an opaque owning-instance identity plus the exact
    committed MODEL, destination, resolved backend TLS, DNS decision, and
    backend-visible query. The committed model is the value that selected the
    provider: final body enforcement compares against it and the claim-owned
    response normalizers stamp the client-visible generation identity from it,
    because a later plugin can rewrite the final body's `model` AND republish
    `ai_stream_router.model` as the same value. Whether the owning transform
    produced the Anthropic representation, and whether the claim forbids tool
    use for this generation, are claim state for the same reason. Every
    `ai_stream_router.*` metadata key is observability/coordination only and is
    never read back for a decision; the sole exception a claim-owned hook still
    reads is `ai_stream_router.provider_content_encoding`, which comes from the
    provider's own response headers and only picks a bounded decoder. The
    committed query is replayed at
    `crate::proxy::effective_backend_query_string*`, the single capture funnel
    for H1/H2, native H3, and retry replay, so later `request_transformer` query
    rules cannot append a normal-backend secret to a third-party URL. The
    destination witness includes `route_override_upstream_id` (cleared at claim,
    required to stay clear) and exact `route_override_resolved_tls` equality, not
    just scheme/host/port/authority/path. A direct provider claim also sets
    `RouteOverrideDnsPolicy::ClearInherited` so
    `RequestContext::apply_route_overrides*` drops an inherited `dns_override`
    even when the host TEXT is unchanged; the default `InheritProxy` keeps
    ordinary same-host route semantics. The public `ai_stream_router_claimed`
    metadata key is likewise observability / third-party coordination only:
    `ai_federation`, `request_mirror`, `serverless_function`, `mcp_gateway`, and
    `mesh_route_dispatch` all stand down on
    `RequestContext::has_ai_stream_router_claim()`, so deleting or rewriting that
    marker cannot re-arm a routing or irreversible-egress decision on a
    provider-bound request. Do not add a built-in decision back onto the marker.
    Intentional pass-through is an UNCLAIMED request and still coordinates
    through `ai_stream_router_pass_through`.
    Multiple same-type instances are allowed
    and may share a provider NAME, so ownership — not the
    `ai_stream_router.provider` metadata key — gates request transformation,
    final header/query enforcement, final body revalidation, response-header
    handling, and response stream inspector/normalizer selection. First matching
    instance claims; `fail_on_missing_model` / `fail_on_no_matching_provider`
    still decide an UNCLAIMED request in normal plugin order.
5c. `evaluate_final_request_body_posture`: the AUTHORITATIVE backend-visible
    request representation phase, run once by
    `run_final_request_body_hooks_with_provenance` immediately before step 6 on
    every dispatch ladder (`GHSA-3973-47g5-4mcx`). A plugin claims a request with
    `enforces_final_request_body_policy` (`waf`, `body_validator`, `graphql`)
    only when its configured policy would BOTH inspect this representation and
    be able to REFUSE it — a `monitor`-mode WAF, a body rule set that only logs,
    and an `on_body_too_large: skip` body outside the scan window all lose an
    observation rather than fail closed, and must not claim;
    for a claimed request whose finalized `Content-Encoding` names a transforming
    coding, the ordered `#content-coding` list is parsed and decoded in reverse
    application order into a staged PLAINTEXT INSPECTION VIEW, and anything
    unsupported / malformed / Large-Window-Brotli / over-4-layers / over-limit /
    over-1024:1 is a fixed
    `400` with a low-cardinality reason that never echoes a token or a body byte.
    The backend still receives the exact client octets and headers — the decode
    is never installed. Claiming hooks MUST read through
    `RequestContext::inspectable_final_request_body` (or the owned
    `inspectable_final_request_body_owned`, an `O(1)` share of the same charged
    allocation); reading the raw slice reopens the bypass, and copying the view
    out with `to_vec()` mints an uncharged duplicate of an attacker-amplified
    body. This phase is independent of `compression`: an enforcing
    policy may not silently depend on a separately configured decompressor.
    Codec strictness and charge ordering come from `plugins::charged_decode`,
    shared with the response gate — the permissive
    `utils::content_encoding` decoder (`BrotliState::new`, `large_window = true`)
    is deliberately unreachable from this security gate. The complete decode
    working set (output capacity, stacked-pass concurrency window, and the ACTIVE
    decoder's own heap, reserved before the decoder is CONSTRUCTED) is charged to
    a process-wide `FERRUM_REQUEST_DECODE_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` budget before
    allocation; the charge is owned by the staged `Bytes` so every disposal path
    releases it by drop and a `RequestContext` clone shares it rather than
    duplicating it. The staged view is ALSO cleared as the hook stage returns, on
    every exit, so the charge lifetime is the hook stage and not the request —
    identical on H1/H2 (throwaway context clone) and native H3 (real context). A
    budget refusal is the GATEWAY-local capacity terminal
    (`503` / `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`), never a `400` and never a backend fault, and
    still never forwards the encoded body. Both terminals carry TYPED provenance
    on the context (`mark_gateway_capacity_response_selected` for the `503`,
    `mark_gateway_representation_response_selected` for the `400`; adopted back
    from the hook clone by `adopt_final_request_body_hook_terminals`) so the
    response-side finalizer publishes the fixed error payload as written rather
    than letting a response schema, WAF response rule, AI guard, or route
    response-size ceiling restate it. The metadata reason beside them is
    plugin-writable and authorizes nothing.
6. `on_final_request_body`: body validator, gRPC-Web validation, WAF body rules, OpenAPI request schema (backend-final fallback), post-transform request-size ceiling, `ai_prompt_compressor` staged marker-sanitization rejection (4055), and `ai_semantic_cache` exact/semantic lookup (4057). `ai_semantic_cache` looks up here — not in `before_proxy` — so its replay partition binds the finalized outbound headers/query/destination and fully transformed request body, and a hit cannot bypass fail-closed final-body policy.
6b. `dispatch_finalized_request_egress`: irreversible outbound request egress
    (`request_mirror`, `serverless_function`, `ai_federation`) over the immutable
    backend-visible body and finalized pre-egress header snapshot, after every
    hook in step 6 accepted it
    (GHSA-4vr5-4wm3-x5xv). A rejection from final request-body policy therefore
    implies no mirror, function, or provider was contacted; backend admission
    and transport checks still occur later. Runs at most once per request
    (`RequestContext.finalized_request_egress_dispatched`), so retries never
    re-fire it. `request_mirror` snapshots the canonical backend-visible query
    through `effective_backend_query_string` and drops deny-by-default sensitive
    query pairs from the mirror request-target only; later mutation of the live
    context cannot change that owned snapshot, and the primary backend target is
    never rewritten. `pre_proxy` header injection goes through the backend header
    overlay, which the proxy merges only after re-stripping reserved gateway
    assertions and re-applying the egress baggage policy. None of these plugins
    has a `before_proxy` egress hook — do not add one back.
7. `after_proxy`: response-side counterpart to before_proxy
   - Successful H1/H2/H3 WebSocket handshakes bypass general `after_proxy` and
     instead run the synchronous, non-rejecting
     `apply_websocket_handshake_response_headers` boundary in configured order.
     Transport-owned handshake/framing fields are stripped afterward and
     restored only by proxy core.
7b. `on_final_response_headers`: header-only effects for the response the proxy
    actually selected, run at the END of the `after_proxy` chain (so a later
    hook's header rules are already applied) and on BOTH the streaming and
    buffered paths. Non-rejecting. This is where work that must not depend on
    collecting a body lives — `response_caching` completes its RFC 9111
    invalidation and cacheability-predictor marking here, which is what lets it
    release a response whose store path the headers already closed
    (GHSA-pwcm-6rh8-f2gh). A plugin that also runs `on_final_response_body` must
    stage this phase's outcome under its own instance-namespaced metadata key and
    consume it there, so one semantic effect never happens twice.
8. `normalize_response_body`: provider/protocol adapters produce the client-visible buffered representation
9. `on_response_body`: AI response guard and token metrics inspect the normalized body
10. `transform_response_body`: ordinary client-facing body rewrites
    - Phases 8 and 10 are the RETAINED-ALLOCATION producer boundary
      (GHSA-pwcm-6rh8-f2gh). A plugin declares
      `Plugin::response_body_production()`; built-in declarations live in one
      table (`builtin_parity::BUILTIN_RESPONSE_BODY_PRODUCERS`) and the default
      for anything outside the built-in inventory is `Undeclared`, which is
      REFUSED rather than invoked. A chain with no declared producer opens no
      transform window. A declared producer is invoked only with a FULL covering
      window, refilled after the previous replacement was installed — never
      while the body it replaced is still alive — and must materialise its
      output through `BoundedResponseBodySink` / `bounded_json_vec` so an
      over-ceiling replacement is refused during construction. Adding a
      `Some`-returning producer hook to a built-in means adding it to that table
      and building through the bounded sink.
10b. `finalize_client_visible_response_body`: the AUTHORITATIVE final
    client-visible response phase (`GHSA-62jg-v563-4q23`,
    `GHSA-4vqr-427g-5cg7`). Phase 10 is SPLIT in two around it: every semantic
    transform first, then this phase, then the TRANSPORT-ENCODING stage
    (`applies_response_transport_encoding` — only `compression`). Rejecting and
    NON-rewriting; a plugin that must rewrite does so in `transform_response_body`
    and verifies the result here. `waf` (response body scan), `body_validator`
    (response validation), and `ai_response_guard` (undischarged-redaction check
    plus a residual re-detection; `warn` still passes through) own it. Response
    HEADER policy is NOT decided here — the header map is not final at this point
    on the synthetic lifecycle; see 10c. It also
    runs when the transform phase is skipped for an unclaimed `206`/`226`, on both
    the backend buffered lifecycle and the synthetic/short-circuit lifecycle. Do
    not move gateway compression back ahead of it, and do not move these
    decisions back into `on_final_response_body` — that hook runs after transport
    encoding.
    On the SYNTHETIC lifecycle the phase returns a WITNESS (the HTTP status,
    exact plaintext bytes, and policy-scope headers it read them under) and is
    RE-DECIDED at the end of
    `apply_reject_after_proxy_and_synthetic_body_hooks`, after the
    deliberately-late reject-path `after_proxy` chain, because that chain is the
    last thing that can relabel the representation and thereby activate a policy
    that never saw these bytes. Scope is every `Content-*` field except
    `Content-Length` and the `Content-Security-Policy` family, plus
    `grpc-status`/`grpc-message`; HTTP status is compared exactly. Headers are
    compared AFTER normalizing the gateway's own transport encoding back out — so
    an unchanged representation is never re-inspected or re-charged, and
    `compression` alone never triggers a sweep. The legacy
    `on_final_response_body` participants
    (`ai_semantic_firewall`) are re-decided in the same sweep. A refusal rebuilds
    through the same `PRESERVED_GATEWAY_RESPONSE_DECORATORS` path as 10c, then the
    rebuild is checked STRUCTURALLY (it must carry exactly the gateway-authored
    `Content-Type: application/json` scope) and collapses to the fixed
    decorator-free terminal otherwise. Do NOT re-sweep the policies over that
    rebuild: a gateway-authored error payload is never re-decided against operator
    rules written for application responses, and doing so turns any configured
    JSON response schema into a permanent 500. Gateway terminals (capacity,
    deadline, an earlier rejection, the route body-size refusal, the request
    representation `400`) are never re-decided either. A late reject-path
    replacement skips re-decision only when the built-in explicitly declares
    `rejection_replacement_is_final_body_policy_terminal` (`spec_expose` HEAD,
    compression's fixed negotiation `406`, `mcp_gateway` JSON-RPC shaping).
    Mere `may_replace_rejection_response` is not enough: an ordinary
    fail-closed/custom replacement remains subject to status and representation
    scope comparison. The final-terminal record is typed, set only on that path,
    and consumed exactly once. Do not
    "fix" this by running `after_proxy` twice. `waf`/`body_validator`/`ai_response_guard` additionally claim an
    ORIGIN-ENCODED response through `enforces_response_body_policy` (narrow: only
    when their rules apply AND their configured disposition can actually refuse —
    `monitor` mode and `ai_response_guard`'s `warn` never claim — only on the
    pristine `ORIGIN_ENCODED_RESPONSE` stamp, never for framed gRPC) so the
    representation gate decodes it or fails it closed.
10c. `finalize_client_visible_response_headers`: the AUTHORITATIVE final
    client-visible response HEADER phase, and the LAST rejecting phase in the
    response lifecycle (`GHSA-62jg-v563-4q23`). Separate from 10b because the
    header map does not close where the body does. It runs at exactly two points:
    the END of the `after_proxy` chain inside `run_after_proxy_hooks` (shared by
    H1/H2, native gRPC, gRPC-Web, and both H3 paths; streaming as well as
    buffered — a rejection surfaces as an ordinary `after_proxy` rejection), and
    the END of `apply_reject_after_proxy_and_synthetic_body_hooks`, AFTER the
    reject-path `after_proxy` chain that lifecycle deliberately defers to last.
    That deferral keeps one-shot response state (the `oidc_relying_party` rotated
    session cookie, the consumed `response_transformer` route override)
    exactly-once and on the real final response; this phase closes the resulting
    enforcement window WITHOUT re-running the chain. Do not "fix" it by running
    `after_proxy` twice. `waf` owns it, gated on an instance-scoped DETERMINISTIC
    CANONICAL digest of the header map (sorted length-prefixed pairs — never an
    XOR fold, which cancels case-variant duplicate pairs and would suppress the
    recheck). A rejection is rebuilt IN PLACE from
    `PRESERVED_GATEWAY_RESPONSE_DECORATORS` (the `security_headers` set, the CORS
    contract, correlation/tracing, and the one-shot rotated `Set-Cookie`) plus
    the rejection's own fields: everything the backend or synthetic producer
    contributed — including the refused field and the stale representation
    metadata of the discarded body — is dropped, so the rebuild cannot resurrect
    it. Policy is re-evaluated exactly ONCE over the rebuild, and a second
    refusal collapses to a fixed minimal gateway terminal. Gateway transport-encoding fields written
    after the chain are governed by `sanitize_client_response_headers_for_wire`,
    not by a further policy pass.
11. `on_final_response_body`: dedup/cache store, size limiting, response cache predictor
12. `log`: stdout/statsd/http/tcp/kafka/loki/udp/ws/tx_debug/prometheus/chargeback
13. `on_ws_frame`: WS size, rate, frame logging, and `waf` complete-message
    body-rule inspection
    - `waf` resolves every request-scoped predicate ONCE at upgrade admission
      through `Plugin::bind_ws_session` (`GHSA-6j3m-vf5h-pgcx`); the relay
      substitutes the session-bound instance positionally, so priority order is
      unchanged and each configured instance processes each message once.
      Client→backend messages run the request body rule set, backend→client the
      response set; Text and Binary are both inspected and the HTTP media-type
      selectors do not apply. Control frames are never scanned as application
      payload, and `max_scan_bytes` / `on_body_too_large` / `on_scan_timeout`
      fail closed with a fixed 1008 Close that never echoes message bytes.
    - First terminal Close from an admission/mutating hook wins; later mutating
      plugins are skipped for that frame while observational hooks
      (`observes_ws_frame_decisions`) may still record the final decision.
    - Delivery-accurate observers use `prepare_ws_frame_delivery` /
      `emit_ws_frame_delivery` after the control-frame guard and a successful
      destination sink accept (same success boundary as frame/byte counters).
      Peer Close bypasses mutating hooks and is observed on that delivery path.
14. `on_stream_connect` / `on_stream_disconnect`: TCP+TLS after handshake; UDP+DTLS after DTLS handshake
15. `on_udp_datagram`: bidirectional datagram hooks only when `requires_udp_datagram_hooks()`

Per-instance execution triggers gate the CONTEXTLESS phases (12, 13, 14, 15) by
carrying ONE opaque decision from the authoritative admission point, never by
re-evaluating a predicate later. `TransactionSummary.plugin_trigger_decisions`
is stamped centrally in `plugins::log_with_mirror` (the single HTTP-family
terminal funnel, mirror entries included);
`StreamTransactionSummary.plugin_trigger_decisions` comes from
`on_stream_connect`; WebSocket decisions are taken in
`proxy::collect_websocket_size_limit_plugins` /
`collect_websocket_relay_plugins` / `collect_websocket_disconnect_plugins`
BEFORE the session's capability set exists, so a skipped instance forces neither
framing nor a parser ceiling and cannot pull a session off the raw tunnel path;
UDP/DTLS decisions filter the session's datagram-hook list ONCE at first-datagram
admission (`plugins::admitted_datagram_plugins`), so nothing is evaluated,
allocated, hashed, or locked per packet. Carriers are non-serialized,
crate-constructed, keyed by the compiled gate's process-local token (never chain
position, load order, plugin name, or plugin-writable metadata), and owned by the
plugin generation that minted the gate. Explicit `false` skips, explicit `true`
runs, and a MISSING carrier RUNS and increments the unlabeled
`plugin_triggers.missing_decision_carriers` counter — never silently suppress a
security or audit hook on missing state. A stream-only plugin may not carry an
identity predicate or an HTTP-only predicate (`method`/`path`/`host`/`header`/
`query`/`cookie`); publication names the field.

Streaming response inspectors are staged: `Normalize` runs before `Inspect`,
with configured plugin order preserved within each stage. Do not hard-code
plugin names or change request-side priorities to obtain response representation
ordering.

Plugin rejects for `application/grpc` must become trailers-only gRPC errors. The single
exception is the `serverless_function` terminate contract: a validated function response
stamps request-scoped provenance (`RequestContext.serverless_grpc_terminate_frame`) that
authorizes exactly that byte-identical frame to be emitted as HEADERS + one uncompressed
unary DATA frame + plugin-authored terminal trailers. Reject body shape and reject
`content-type`/`grpc-status` headers are never provenance, and the terminate contract is
entered only for the request-scoped native-gRPC flavor the frontend stamps at intake —
never for a mutable effective `content-type`. Authorization binds the authored HTTP status
as well as the frame bytes, and that authorized representation — and only it — runs the
shared synthetic response-body policy lifecycle so configured gRPC response validators are
not bypassed. Invalidated authorization (rewritten frame, replaced response, changed
status) FAILS CLOSED: the body is dropped and a residual `grpc-status: 0` is replaced by
the rejection's own status, or `INTERNAL` — never emitted as an empty Trailers-Only
success. The status-only shape stamps the same provenance with an EMPTY frame: it can
never authorize DATA, but while the reply is unchanged (authored status, still-empty body)
it stays trailers-only and its COMPLETE terminal metadata (`grpc-status`, optional
`grpc-message`, `grpc-status-details-bin`, validated custom trailers) is restored from the
authored provenance instead of the decorated reject header map; an omitted `grpc_message`
stays omitted rather than becoming a synthesized reason. A changed status or an unauthored
body fails closed identically AND discards every terminal key the contract authored, so a
replacement error never ships beside the original contract's `grpc-status-details-bin` or
custom trailers. `grpc_message` is authored as text and emitted percent-encoded per the
gRPC HTTP mapping, with the 8 KiB wire ceiling measured on the encoded value.
That per-field ceiling bounds one value; the COMPLETE terminal block
(`grpc-status`, `grpc-message`, `grpc-status-details-bin`, every custom trailer,
and `content-type`) carries a separate 16 KiB aggregate budget charged as
name + value + 32 bytes per field — the HTTP/2 `SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE` /
HTTP/3 `SETTINGS_MAX_FIELD_SECTION_SIZE` accounting — so 32 individually valid
8 KiB trailers cannot authorize ~256 KiB of terminal metadata.
The raw function output is screened with the shared bounded
`crate::util::json_dup_keys` scanner BEFORE `serde_json::from_slice`: a duplicate
object member name (byte-identical, escaped-equivalent, or nested inside
`trailers`) makes the authored terminal metadata parser-dependent, so it fails
closed under the fixed `invalid_grpc_terminate_response` class with a
fixed-cardinality reason that never echoes body bytes. Do not add a second
ad hoc duplicate-key parser here.
`request_deduplication` is not in this picture at all — it is `HTTP_ONLY_PROTOCOLS` while
`HttpFlavor::Grpc` selects the `ProxyProtocol::Grpc` plugin view, so it is never effective
on a native-gRPC request.

## Request Context And Body Rules

- Multi-auth accepts `ctx.identified_consumer` or `ctx.authenticated_identity`; first success wins. Empty chain rejects.
- `ctx.auth_method: Option<&'static str>` is set by `run_auth_impl()` on first successful auth and by stream mTLS auth. Values are compiled-in literals from `AuthMechanism::mechanism_name()`.
- `auth_method` flows to `TransactionSummary`, `StreamTransactionSummary`, and `WsDisconnectContext` for HTTP/1.1, H2, H3, gRPC, WebSocket, TCP, UDP, and DTLS.
- Multi-credential rotation stores each credential type as an array. `FERRUM_MAX_CREDENTIALS_PER_TYPE` defaults to 2.
- `PUT /consumers/:id/credentials/:type` replaces the array, `POST` appends one entry, and `DELETE .../:index` removes one entry.
- Indexable credentials insert all entries into `ConsumerIndex`; secret-based credentials iterate over the array.
- Body buffering is two-tier: `PluginCache.requires_request/response_body_buffering()` for the upper bound, then per-request `should_buffer_*_body(&RequestContext)`.
- A body-consuming policy plugin selects on its configured representation, never
  on the request method, and never degrades to `Continue` for an empty, absent,
  or non-UTF-8 body once a configured rule applies (`GHSA-2vmr-ww8r-mww3`).
  `body_validator` is the reference: early `before_proxy` prefers a rewritten
  UTF-8 `request_body` metadata view when present (composition with
  `ai_prompt_shield`), falls back to `ctx.request_body_bytes` when no text view
  exists (retained via `needs_request_body_bytes()` so non-UTF-8 cannot look
  like "no body"), treats `ctx.replay_request_body_empty_proven()` as the
  transport's own empty proof, and fails closed otherwise. The final
  request-body hook still validates the exact backend-visible bytes. Native
  gRPC always runs `parse_grpc_frame`. The only exemptions are protocol-defined:
  empty terminal gRPC *error* replies (a single valid non-zero `grpc-status`),
  and responses with no content by status/method semantics (1xx, 204, 205, 304,
  `HEAD`). Representation-gap diagnostics are fixed strings and never echo body
  bytes.
- A configured finalized-egress plugin forces buffered request-body
  finalization to complete BEFORE backend dispatch (the `has_finalized_request_egress`
  term in `final_request_body_requirements`), because the ordinary ladder
  otherwise finalizes inside `proxy_to_backend`. On H1/H2 that term is gated to
  non-gRPC initially; once routing selects the transport, protocol-classified
  gRPC that uses generic dispatch is also pulled through terminal preparation.
  Native gRPC reaches the egress boundary from its own branch after its own
  transform/final-hook pass.
- Composition admission fails closed for anything that still egresses earlier:
  `egresses_request_body_before_finalization()` may not coexist with a
  request-body transformer, with any built-in final request hook that can reject
  the backend-visible body on an HTTP/gRPC request-body protocol
  (`enforces_finalized_request_policy()`), or with
  `dispatches_finalized_request_egress()` on the same plugin.
- gRPC uses `GrpcBody::Streaming(Incoming)` when there are no body plugins and no retries; otherwise `Buffered(Full<Bytes>)`.
- In `before_proxy(ctx, headers)`, read headers from the `headers` parameter, never `ctx.headers`. The handler may have moved headers out of `ctx.headers` when no plugin modifies request headers.
- `ctx.authenticated_identity` is first-class for rate-limit/cache keys, log summaries, and backend identity header injection.
- `response_mock` strips a proxy prefix `listen_path` before rule matching, except for root, regex, exact (`=`), and host-only scopes. It supports HTTP and WebSocket upgrade handshakes only (not native gRPC): a match short-circuits the HTTP handshake response and does not mock upgraded frame streams. Native gRPC is excluded because `response_mock` has no provenance-authorized framed unary `Reject` contract; only `serverless_function` terminate does.

## Mesh Authz Plugin

- Every `MeshPolicy` carries `PolicyScope`; mesh_authz must filter `slice.mesh_policies` at construction using `policy_scope_applies_to_workload(policy, proxy_namespace, proxy_labels)`.
- Without filtering, namespace-scoped DENY and unrelated ALLOW policies can affect the wrong workload. Do not remove the cold-path filter.
- Proxy identity comes from embedded `mesh_slice` namespace/labels, explicit plugin JSON `namespace`/`labels`, or both with explicit fields winning.
- Empty `WorkloadSelector` intentionally matches any workload.
- Node-waypoint topology is the exception: construction filter is skipped with `per_pod_policy_scoping: true`.
- Node-waypoint request path uses `ctx.node_waypoint_policy_scope` and `PolicyScopeCache::policy_applies`.
- Missing node-waypoint scope sets `ctx.metadata["mesh_authz.scope_missing"] = "true"`. On **both** the HTTP/HBONE request path and stream (TCP/UDP) connections, a missing scope **fails closed** (Reject 403, `mesh_authz.deny_policy = scope_missing`) when any namespace/selector-scoped policy is configured; with only mesh-wide policies the mesh is fully evaluable and it falls through to mesh-wide-only. (Since the resolver derives a pod's scope from the same single slice generation that vouches its identity, a missing scope is not an enrollment race — it means the workload left the live slice gate, so a long-lived HTTP/2 connection from a removed workload must not keep serving with scoped policies silently withheld.)
- Slice apply stages workload SPIFFE scope index before validation and publishes only after `proxy_state.update_config` accepts the plugin cache.
- Istio empty-rule semantics apply here too: ALLOW with no rules is allow-nothing; DENY/AUDIT with no rules are no-ops.

## Transaction Logs And Redaction

- `TransactionSummary` and `StreamTransactionSummary` live in `src/plugins/mod.rs`.
- HTTP summaries carry body-streaming fields such as `body_error_class`, `body_completed`, and `bytes_streamed`.
- Stream summaries carry `disconnect_direction` and `disconnect_cause`.
- Error classifiers include reqwest, gRPC proxy, boxed, H2 pool, and H3 classifiers.
- Summary `metadata` serializes through `metadata_redaction::serialize_redacted_metadata`.
- Redact metadata values when lowercased key contains built-ins: `authorization`, `cookie`, `set-cookie`, `x-api-key`, `x-auth-token`, `x-csrf-token`, `bearer`, `password`, `secret`, `token`.
- Also redact operator substrings from `FERRUM_LOG_REDACT_METADATA_KEYS`.
- Redaction happens at serialization; in-memory metadata stays unchanged for later plugin phases.
- New logger sinks get redaction automatically only if they serialize `TransactionSummary` / `StreamTransactionSummary` through serde.

## Log Schema

- `src/plugins/utils/log_schema/` lets operators shape logger output with `schema:` or `schema_ref:`.
- It supports rename, omit, reorder, static fields, derived fields, metadata flatten/omit, and timestamp conversion.
- Default path must remain byte-for-byte identical and zero allocation when no schema is configured.
- Metadata redaction must apply for renamed metadata and flattened metadata too.
- `transaction_log_schema` is global-only and constructed first during plugin-cache rebuild so later plugins can resolve `schema_ref`.
- `prometheus_metrics` still rejects `schema:` / `schema_ref:` — its label names are baked into the time-series store.
- `SchemaCapabilities.family` (`RecordFamily`) selects the field inventory. Non-summary families: `api_chargeback` (the `/charges` per-proxy billing row), `api_chargeback_sink` (the exported `ChargeEvent`), `transaction_debugger` (its own HTTP/stream/WS diagnostic names). A family rejects, with a plugin- and field-specific diagnostic, whatever it cannot express: `summary_type`, `timestamp_format`, and `metadata` for the two chargeback families, `order` for the chargeback report (sorted `serde_json::Map` document), `backend_host` for charge events, and every derived kind but `summary_kind` for the billing row.
- Projection applies only at the externally emitted representation. It must never reach billing identity, charge accounting, registry/accumulator/snapshot keys, Prometheus labels, or spool ownership.
- `api_chargeback`'s projection governs the one process-global render cache, so `validate_composition` requires every enabled instance to agree on `schema` / `schema_ref` exactly like the other shared tunables.
- `api_chargeback_sink` projects at `write_json_each_row`, the single funnel for the ClickHouse INSERT body and the durable spool artifact. `charge_body_byte_bound` must keep adding the precomputed per-row projection surcharge so the retained-byte reservation still precedes serialization.
- Field-registry drift is covered by `tests/integration/log_schema_registry_tests.rs`.

## Centralized Rate Limiting

- `rate_limiting`, `graphql`, `grpc_method_router`, `ai_rate_limiter`,
  `ws_rate_limiting`, and `udp_rate_limiting` support `sync_mode: "redis"`.
- Shared Redis client lives in `src/plugins/utils/redis_rate_limiter.rs`.
- Algorithm is two-window weighted with pipelined `INCR`/`GET`/`EXPIRE`; no Lua.
- Key format is `{escaped-prefix:escaped-rate-key}:{window_index}` — the braces
  are a Redis Cluster hash tag so every key of one atomic operation shares a
  slot; `%`, braces, and `:` are percent-escaped inside it. Default prefix is
  `{FERRUM_NAMESPACE}:{plugin_name}:{plugin-config-id}` — the config-id component
  isolates independent policies of one plugin type inside a namespace while
  replicas of the same policy keep sharing a budget. An explicit
  `redis_key_prefix` is the shared-budget opt-in.
- Every rate-limit window is bounded by `MAX_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS`
  (2678400), and ordinary HTTP/GraphQL/gRPC request caps are bounded by
  `MAX_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` (1000000);
  TTL/retention math uses the saturating helpers in
  `src/plugins/utils/rate_limit.rs`. Local sliding windows retain a fixed
  `SLIDING_WINDOW_BUCKET_COUNT` (64) aggregate buckets per key — never one
  timestamp per request. All six Redis-backed rate-limit plugin roots
  (`rate_limiting`, `graphql`, `grpc_method_router`, `ai_rate_limiter`,
  `ws_rate_limiting`, `udp_rate_limiting`) are closed key sets enforced by
  `reject_unknown_keys` against the plugin's `*_CONFIG_KEYS` allowlist, and each
  must stay in exact parity with an `additionalProperties: false` OpenAPI
  schema. A new root key therefore lands in the runtime allowlist,
  `openapi.yaml`, and `docs/plugins.md` together — none of these roots accepts
  an undeclared property. Parity is enforced by
  `rate_limiter_configs_are_closed_and_bounded_in_openapi` and
  `graphql_config_schema_matches_runtime_validation` in
  `tests/unit/openapi_yaml_tests.rs`.
- Redis outage behavior is `redis_failure_policy` (`fail_closed` default,
  `local_fallback` opt-in); only the opt-in falls back to in-memory. The client
  reconnects in the background either way. `request_deduplication` expresses the
  same choice as `on_redis_unavailable` and does NOT accept
  `redis_failure_policy`; `ai_semantic_cache` has neither.
- Redis Cluster is NOT supported and is screened, not assumed: `INFO CLUSTER`
  at connect plus `MOVED`/`ASK`/`CROSSSLOT`/`CLUSTERDOWN`/`TRYAGAIN` reactively.
  The proactive probe is bounded by `redis_connect_timeout_seconds` (no new
  key); an unanswered probe is a retryable outage, never proof of Cluster, and
  its unscreened connection must not carry a policy command.
  Rejection is terminal for the client — recovery pings must never clear it, and
  no connection publication, command success, or recovery that completes after
  the rejection may restore availability (one `EnforcementAvailability` atomic;
  `publish_reachable` cannot beat `reject_topology`).
- `ai_rate_limiter` admission only reserves an estimate, so the authoritative
  post-response reconciliation is also fail-closed: an `enforcement_unavailable`
  charge on a 2xx returns the same generic 503 as admission. A non-2xx response
  keeps its status (a failed charge/release there only over-counts).
- Local and explicit Redis-fallback maps reserve hard cardinality atomically:
  existing keys retain their active budgets at capacity, while previously unseen
  keys fail closed until idle-state pruning frees a slot.
- `redis_username` and `redis_password` plugin fields are honored on plain and TLS code paths and override URL user-info.
- `rediss://` uses global `FERRUM_TLS_*`.

## Adding Or Validating Plugins

- New plugin file: `src/plugins/my_plugin.rs`, implements `Plugin`, constructor returns `Result<Self, String>`.
- Add a priority constant in `src/plugins/mod.rs`.
- Override `supported_protocols()` when not HTTP-only. Use the existing protocol constants.
- Register in `create_plugin_with_http_client()` with `?` on `new()` and add to `available_plugins()`.
- Add unit tests for valid and invalid configs in `tests/unit/plugins/` and register the module.
- Update `FEATURES.md`, `README.md`, `docs/plugin_execution_order.md`, `src/plugins/builtin_parity.rs` (`BUILTIN_PLUGIN_PARITY_META`), and `openapi.yaml`. CI enforces registry/order-table/protocol-matrix set parity via `tests/unit/plugins/plugin_doc_parity_tests.rs`.
- All `new()` constructors return `Result<Self, String>`. Return `Err` for no-op config, invalid regex/enum/ranges, or impossible behavior.
- Plugin `config` objects are closed. Use `crate::util::unknown_keys::reject_unknown_keys` against a `*_CONFIG_KEYS` allowlist. FailClosed and KeepLastKnownGood constructors return `Err`. OptionalFailOpen constructors also return `Err` so the validation pipeline / plugin cache can warn and omit the instance (`stdout_logging`); do not swallow typos. `mcp_gateway` `command`/`args`/`stdio` must fail with an HTTP-only message, not a generic unknown-key error.
- Admin API validation uses `validate_plugin_config_definition()` and returns HTTP 400. File mode validation fails startup. DB mode warns for existing bad data.
- Shared entrypoint is `plugins::validate_plugin_config(name, config)`.

## File Dependencies And Custom Plugins

- Backend TLS file validation belongs to `validate_all_fields_with_ip_policy()`: file mode fatal, DB/CP admin warn, DP rejects update and keeps old config.
- Plugin file dependencies, such as MaxMind `.mmdb`, belong to `validate_plugin_file_dependencies()`: file fatal; DB warns for absent/unreadable files; CP admin validates structure but skips node-local files; DP validates and refreshes its node-local files off the runtime worker for full snapshots and affected incremental rebuilds. On DB/DP runtime nodes, absent/unreadable files use the configured request-time fallback, while readable invalid files reject the new plugin generation. Exception: a DP forced node-local refresh retains the live generation's last-known-good MMDB snapshot for a temporarily unavailable path instead of degrading. Retention is keyed on `db_path` and the instance is still rebuilt from the incoming config, so a concurrent geo policy change applies and a repointed `db_path` never inherits the old snapshot.
- Plugin constructors with file deps should tolerate missing files, log a warning, store `None`, and apply configured request-time fallback policy.
- Frontend TLS cert failure is always fatal.
- Custom plugins live under `custom_plugins/` and may export `plugin_migrations() -> Vec<CustomPluginMigration>`.
- SQL plugin migrations are tracked in `_ferrum_plugin_migrations` by `(plugin_name, version)`.
- `FERRUM_AUTO_APPLY_PLUGIN_MIGRATIONS=false` warns on pending plugin migrations at database/cp startup; it does not mutate schema.
- `FERRUM_AUTO_APPLY_PLUGIN_MIGRATIONS=true` applies pending plugin migrations before `load_full_config`; failure is fatal.
- Standalone migrate mode always applies plugin migrations. MongoDB custom plugin migration support is constructor-created collections/indexes only.

## Notifications

- `src/notifications/` is plugin-agnostic and reusable from overload manager, mesh policy enforcement, or custom plugins.
- `proxy_alerts` is one consumer of the notification layer, not the owner.
- Keep channel dispatch bounded-concurrency and templating `${var}` compatible with `docs/notifications.md`.
