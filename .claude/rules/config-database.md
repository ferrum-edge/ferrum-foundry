# Config And Database Rules

## Domain Model

- `GatewayConfig` contains `Proxy`, `Consumer`, `Upstream`, and `PluginConfig`. Each has `namespace`, defaulting to `ferrum`.
- `ApiSpec` is intentionally not in `GatewayConfig`; it is admin-only metadata.
- `Proxy`, `Upstream`, and `PluginConfig` carry optional `api_spec_id` ownership tags. Do not strip or repurpose them.
- `FERRUM_NAMESPACE` controls what a gateway loads. DB queries filter by namespace. File mode filters after deserialize. Admin API uses `X-Ferrum-Namespace`.
- Uniqueness is per namespace for listen path, proxy name, consumer identity, and upstream name. Stream listen ports use application-level group admission instead of a unique database index: one port may hold a validated opaque-TLS SNI group or L4 `stream_match` group, while every other duplicate shape is rejected from the exact post-mutation namespace snapshot under the admission lease. Same listen port across namespaces remains allowed at config level; OS bind catches real conflicts.
- Consumer ids are per-namespace (SQL PK `(namespace, id)`; Mongo consumer `_id` is `"{namespace}:{id}"`). Consumer id, username, and custom_id share ONE identity keyspace per namespace, enforced in persistence by the `consumer_identity_index` table/collection written transactionally with every consumer write (cross-field collisions are 409s; self-collisions within one consumer are allowed). Full config loads quarantine pre-existing colliding consumers fail-closed via `GatewayConfig::quarantine_colliding_consumer_identities()` — do not revert to warn-and-overwrite.
- ID-only `DatabaseBackend` reads/deletes/updates are namespace-predicated at the query level (`get_/delete_/update_*` carry the namespace in the WHERE clause / filter document); update methods return `Ok(false)` on zero matched rows and must not emit a config-change record for phantom updates.
- Hostname normalization is ASCII-lowercase at admission through `normalize_fields()` for `Proxy.hosts`, `Proxy.backend_host`, and `UpstreamTarget.host`.
- Apply normalization at admin API, loaders, DP gRPC, and restore entrypoints. Do not re-lowercase in DNS, pool, health, or LB keys.

## Multi-Namespace CP/DP

- `FERRUM_CP_NAMESPACES` controls CP scope. Empty or unset is back-compatible `Single(FERRUM_NAMESPACE)`, `*` is cluster-wide, CSV is an explicit set.
- `src/grpc/cp_server.rs::NamespaceBroadcasts` partitions broadcasts by namespace so DPs receive only their namespace slice.
- DP still runs `dp_client::filter_config_to_namespace` as defense in depth.
- `FERRUM_CP_REQUIRE_NAMESPACE_CLAIM=true` requires DP `ConfigSync.Subscribe` JWTs to carry an `ns` claim, string or array, authorizing the subscribe namespace.
- xDS ADS, MeshConfigSync, and the K8s controller broadcast hook still use the back-compatible single-namespace sender. Do not claim multi-namespace support on those surfaces until implemented.

## Config Admission And Schemas

- New config fields go in `src/config/types.rs` with `#[serde(default)]` when optional.
- Env-driven fields also update `src/config/env_config.rs`, `docs/configuration.md`, and `ferrum.conf`.
- SQL storage changes are folded into `src/config/migrations/v001_initial_schema.rs` during build-out, with parsing in `db_loader.rs`.
- MongoDB persists through serde BSON unless a queried field needs an index in
  `src/config/mongo_index_plan.rs` (consumed by `MongoStore::run_migrations()`,
  migrate dry-run, and migrate status).
- Add unit tests under `tests/unit/config/` and update `openapi.yaml` when admin-exposed.
- Required new fields need a migration/versioning plan even in build-out; do not silently make old config deserialize differently unless intended.
- Check parent structs for `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` before adding fields.

## Database Backends

- Supported stores are PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite through sqlx, and MongoDB.
- SQLite must keep `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`, `busy_timeout=5000`, and `foreign_keys=ON` through `after_connect`.
- `DatabaseBackend` in `src/config/db_backend.rs` is the shared trait. `DatabaseStore` and `MongoStore` both implement it. Admin and modes use `Arc<dyn DatabaseBackend>`.
- SQL wraps multi-step CRUD in `sqlx::Transaction`.
- MongoDB single-doc writes are atomic. Multi-doc atomicity requires `FERRUM_MONGO_REPLICA_SET`; otherwise flows must be idempotent with poll-cycle cleanup.
- `FERRUM_DB_FAILOVER_URLS` uses the same `FERRUM_DB_TYPE`.
- Admin config-database writes fail closed while the active pool is on a
  failover URL unless `FERRUM_DB_FAILOVER_ALLOW_WRITES=true` (opt-in only for
  operator-asserted synchronously replicated multi-primary topologies).
  Polling/reads stay available. After an opt-in Admin mutation is admitted,
  a process-local automatic-primary-failback fence remains armed until the
  process is restarted after operator reconciliation or confirmed replication
  catch-up, so a stale primary cannot replace failover-side configuration. The
  fence is exposed on authenticated `/health`, does not
  suppress healthy failover reconnect candidates, and is not coordinated
  across gateway replicas. Topology/divergence signals use redacted URLs only.
  Config-database mutation handlers admit under
  a write-topology pin (SQL reconnect `RwLock` read / Mongo distinct
  `admin_write_topology` `RwLock` read) retained for the full persistence
  lifetime so a reconnect cannot redirect an already-admitted write; Mongo
  admission continues to pin only `connection_generation` (publication
  `try_write`s Admin topology then generation, both fail-fast; failover marks
  before publish and primary marks after publish, both under those guards).
  Managed TLS/ACME handlers use the non-topology write gate only (read-only +
  database-unavailable) and must not pin or inherit sticky DB failover policy.
  Observe-only `/health` uses the synchronous policy check;
  `admin_writes_enabled` reports config-database mutation admission.
- Runtime config polling is authoritative and primary-consistent: startup full loads, incremental change-log reads, relationship reads, cursor advancement, and accepted association state must not use SQL read replicas or MongoDB secondary read preferences.
- `FERRUM_DB_READ_REPLICA_URL` is SQL-only and may offload eligible admin-only reads; writes and runtime polling always use primary. Replica query failure must mark the replica unavailable and retry the admin read on primary.
- MongoDB replica-set failover comes from listing members in `FERRUM_DB_URL`; Ferrum's config store forces primary reads and ignores URL read preferences.
- MongoDB pool sizing comes from driver URL options such as `maxPoolSize` and `minPoolSize`; `FERRUM_DB_POOL_*` is ignored.

## Incremental Polling And Broadcast

- `FERRUM_DB_POLL_INTERVAL` defaults to 30s.
- Startup performs a full load and seeds the accepted durable change sequence. Subsequent SQL and MongoDB polls read `config_changes` after that sequence, collapse each resource to its final operation in the batch, and point-load changed IDs only.
- Poll results are validated before apply; on reject, the accepted sequence remains unchanged.
- Poll failure or an expired retained sequence auto-falls back to full reload.
- CP broadcasts deltas through a tokio broadcast channel sized by `FERRUM_CP_BROADCAST_CHANNEL_CAPACITY`.
- Lagging DPs automatically receive a full snapshot.
- If config source is unavailable, keep serving the last cached config.

## Database TLS

- Canonical envs are `FERRUM_DB_TLS_MODE`, `FERRUM_DB_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH`, `FERRUM_DB_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_PATH`, and `FERRUM_DB_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_PATH`.
- SQL modes support `disable`, `allow`, `prefer`, `require`, `verify-ca`, and `verify-full` subject to backend limits.
- MySQL rejects `allow`.
- MongoDB supports only `disable`, `require`, and `verify-full`.
- SQLite accepts only `disable` and rejects cert paths and other TLS modes.
- Keep `docs/database_tls.md`, `docs/configuration.md`, and env parsing synchronized.

## File Mode And Validation

- File mode is read-only admin plus proxy. It loads YAML/JSON and reloads on SIGHUP on Unix.
- Config validators must behave by mode: file mode should fail startup for invalid local config, DB mode should warn for bad existing data when appropriate, DP should reject bad updates and keep cached config.
- Backend TLS cert paths are validated by `validate_all_fields_with_ip_policy()`: file mode is fatal, DB/CP admin warns, and DP rejects the update while keeping old config. Frontend TLS cert failure is always fatal; no silent fallback.
- Plugin file dependencies such as MaxMind `.mmdb` are validated separately by `validate_plugin_file_dependencies()`: file mode is fatal; DB warns for absent/unreadable files; CP admin validates structure but skips node-local files because it does not construct proxy plugins; DP full snapshots and affected incremental rebuilds validate/refresh the DP node's local files off the runtime worker. Constructors apply the configured request-time fallback for absent/unreadable files on DB/DP nodes, while readable invalid files reject the candidate and preserve the last published generation. On a DP forced node-local refresh the load session substitutes the live generation's last-known-good snapshot for a temporarily unavailable path (keyed on `db_path`), so a transient outage cannot downgrade an enforcing geo gate; the instance is still rebuilt from the incoming config so policy changes are never stale.

## Proto And gRPC Config Sync

- `proto/ferrum.proto` compiles through `build.rs` and `tonic_build`.
- `ConfigSync` exposes streaming `Subscribe` and unary `GetFullConfig`.
- `FERRUM_REAL_IP_HEADER` is an enforced CP/DP cluster ownership setting. DPs
  advertise an explicitly present effective value (empty means unset) on both
  ConfigSync requests; CP rejects missing or mismatched values before config
  distribution so CP admission and serving-DP correlation ownership cannot diverge.
- CP/DP auth is HS256 JWT in `authorization` metadata. The channel carries that JWT plus the full gateway config, so the transport is secure-by-default: `EnvConfig::validate_cp_dp_grpc_transport_security()` refuses a non-loopback plaintext CP bind and a non-loopback `http://` DP URL unless `FERRUM_CP_DP_GRPC_ALLOW_PLAINTEXT=true`. Loopback (`127.0.0.1`/`::1`/`localhost`) plaintext is always allowed; permitted plaintext still logs a high-severity warning on CP and DP. mTLS (`FERRUM_CP_GRPC_TLS_CLIENT_CA_PATH`) is the only DP auth factor beyond the bearer JWT — warn when CP TLS is configured without it.
- `FERRUM_DP_GRPC_TLS_NO_VERIFY=true` is rejected at startup: tonic's `ClientTlsConfig` exposes no public verifier-skip hook, so the flag never disabled verification (CRL is likewise not applied to the tonic-managed CP/DP client). Pin the CP CA via `FERRUM_DP_GRPC_TLS_CA_CERT_PATH` for self-signed test certs. Do not re-add a no-verify path by hand-rolling a tonic connector.
- A rejected CP/DP trust-bundle reload retains the ENTIRE last accepted verifier, but only for `FERRUM_CP_DP_TRUST_MAX_STALE_SECONDS` (default 900, monotonic, reset only by an accepted reload including a semantically unchanged one). The first refusal marks trust reload degraded on authenticated `/health` (`cp_dp_trust`) and in the `ferrum_cp_dp_trust_*` families; at the bound readiness fails and `bind_to_store` refuses new ConfigSync/MeshSubscribe/SotW-ADS/Delta-ADS admissions while the shared lease ends established streams with `trust_stale`. An unexpectedly dead reload worker fails readiness immediately; a stalled worker (no completed attempt inside three poll intervals, floored at 60s) is immediately degraded and `ferrum_cp_dp_trust_reload_worker_stalled=1` but does not fail readiness inside the bound; a clean shutdown never counts as a failure. `0` is unbounded and requires `FERRUM_CP_DP_TRUST_ALLOW_UNBOUNDED_STALE=true`; a bound below three poll intervals fails startup. Unauthenticated `/health`/`/status` uses the lock-free coarse verdict (no closed-reason-map allocation). Published Prometheus state is fixed-cardinality and carries no path, `kid`, namespace, token, key material, or generation identifier. Authenticated `/health`/`/status` additionally publish `active_generation`, a replica-stable HMAC-SHA-256 of the private configuration fingerprint under fleet-shared `FERRUM_ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` with domain `ferrum-cp-dp-trust-status-id-v1\0` (64 lowercase hex). Never an unkeyed digest. The identifier is incomparable across replicas that do not share the HMAC key, never appears in logs, Prometheus, or errors, and does not reveal the HMAC key. The internal configuration fingerprint stays private to the reload worker as a change detector. `attempts_total` counts attempts started (a wedged in-flight read is visible; acceptances+rejections may trail by one).
- Production CP server uses `CpGrpcServer::with_channel_capacity(env_config.cp_broadcast_channel_capacity)`. `new()` default capacity 128 is for tests.
- DP reconnects priority-ordered CP URLs with exponential backoff from 1s to 30s and plus/minus 25% jitter. Backoff follows the failure sequence across CP switches; a clean close that delivered no config message counts as a failure. A transport/RPC failure after the attempt already accepted config resets backoff to the initial delay (healthy progress) while still failing over. Intentional disconnect may reset without treating the attempt as a failure.
- ConfigSync Subscribe streams use HTTP/2/TCP keepalive plus **negotiated** application heartbeats; DPs reconnect after bounded silence rather than hanging on idle `message().await`. Negotiation is additive and fail-safe in both directions: DP sets `SubscribeRequest.supports_heartbeat`, CP echoes `ConfigUpdate.heartbeat_negotiated` on the initial update only. CP emits heartbeat frames only to advertising subscribers; DP arms the `CONFIGSYNC_MAX_SILENCE_SECS` watchdog only after confirmation. Never send unnegotiated heartbeats (a legacy DP reads the empty envelope as an unusable FULL_SNAPSHOT) and never arm the watchdog unconfirmed (a legacy CP cannot break silence). `ConfigSyncStreamTimings` is a per-invocation stack argument, production default `production()`; do not add a global/env override.
- ConfigSync DELTA bodies (`IncrementalResult` JSON) are a same-major.minor wire contract. Removal keys are namespace-qualified in memory, but serialize as historical bare-ID arrays (`removed_proxy_ids`/`removed_plugin_config_ids`/`removed_upstream_ids`) plus **additive** `removed_*_keys` objects; `removed_consumer_ids` keeps its object shape. Decoding accepts either shape and the DP qualifies bare IDs with its own authorized subscription namespace (`IncrementalResult::qualify_unqualified_removals`) before `filter_incremental_to_namespace`, so cross-namespace deletion stays impossible. Do not change these field shapes without an upgrade-guide entry.
- A cross-source FULL_SNAPSHOT that is older than (or unorderable against) the applied authority is fenced: the DP refuses it, terminates that stream, and fails over (`DpStreamEnd::StaleSnapshotFenced` → `ConfigSyncAttemptOutcome::StaleSnapshotFenced`, accounted like a connection failure). It must not `continue` on the same stream — that would let the stale CP's next delta apply against newer config. The fence does not mark config received, touch `last_config_received_at`, or update snapshot authority. The one safe exception is an older cross-source snapshot whose complete authoritative payload matches the applied payload: canonical `GatewayConfig` content excluding `loaded_at` plus effective CP gateway-trust side-channel state. Remembered trust equivalence on `AppliedSnapshotAuthority` is `Unknown` until an accepted explicit Clear or Replace establishes Absent/Present; empty/Unchanged side channels leave trust Unknown (or preserve prior Unknown) and fail closed for equivalence — they must never invent Absent. Accepted trust-only Clear/Replace updates refresh that remembered trust view so the exception cannot match against a stale or unestablished trust view. Same-source recovery snapshots stay accepted, and the ordering watermark remains monotonic even when that recovery body is older. Freshness authority also advances from every accepted non-empty resource delta's committed timestamp (not from rejected deltas or empty/trust-only side-channels); resource-delta-only authority construction leaves trust Unknown. A DELTA older than the authority watermark is refused before apply and terminates the stream (`evaluate_delta_authority` → `DpStreamEnd::InvalidDeltaFreshness`), even after an older equivalent snapshot established the current subscription base, preventing ABA replay from a lagging CP. That fence is source-blind on purpose — an accepted cross-source snapshot becomes the authority source, so a same-source exemption would make it inert — and it covers empty/trust-only bodies (a stale trust-only replay is an anchor rollback) without raising divergence for them. `ConfigUpdate.version` must reconcile with the corresponding body stamp (`GatewayConfig.loaded_at` for FULL_SNAPSHOT, `IncrementalResult.poll_timestamp` for DELTA). A committed stamp more than `CONFIGSYNC_MAX_FUTURE_SKEW_SECS` (300s) ahead of the DP's wall clock is refused fail-closed before either snapshot or delta apply (`evaluate_snapshot_clock_skew` → `StaleSnapshotReject::ImplausiblyFutureStamp`) so a skewed/hostile CP clock cannot poison the monotonic watermark; never clamp the untrusted stamp into authority. Same-source detection canonicalizes CP endpoint URLs to `(scheme, host, port)` (`cp_endpoints_same_source`), so a trailing slash is not cross-source while distinct scheme/host/port stay distinct and malformed URLs fall back to exact equality. The complete-payload equivalence check is lazy — only computed for a cross-source candidate strictly older than a parseable applied watermark (`snapshot_requires_older_payload_exception`) — and it compares like against like: the candidate first goes through `ProxyState::canonicalize_snapshot_for_comparison`, which reproduces the pre-swap canonicalization `update_config` applies before storing (normalize, resolve upstream TLS, HMAC quarantine, gateway workload-metrics identity injection). Comparing a raw CP payload against the applied config would make the exception silently inert on any node those steps touch (notably a DP with a gateway SVID); keep the two in step when adding a pre-swap mutation. Every fenced FULL_SNAPSHOT (stale/older, unorderable/inconsistent, or implausibly-future skew) increments the fixed-cardinality `ferrum_configsync_fenced_full_snapshots_total` counter and does not raise sticky `config_diverged`; an inconsistent, implausibly-future, or stale (pre-watermark) non-empty DELTA raises sticky divergence and fails over with accumulating backoff. Each subscription must commit a valid FULL_SNAPSHOT before any DELTA — `SubscriptionApplyState` starts `base_applied = false` even when `startup_ready` is `None` (startup readiness is independent). An unusable FULL_SNAPSHOT always terminates the subscription (`snapshot_failure_stream_disposition` → terminate/reconnect); mid-stream failures after an accepted base keep last-known-good config and force a fresh authoritative snapshot. A pre-snapshot DELTA terminates with accumulating failure backoff. After any non-empty DELTA parse/validation/apply rejection (or unclassifiable parse / invalid trust side-channel), stop consuming the stream, raise sticky `config_diverged`, and reconnect for FULL_SNAPSHOT recovery; clear divergence only after an accepted FULL_SNAPSHOT. Decision seam: `configsync_lifecycle::full_snapshot_stream_disposition` / `evaluate_delta_against_subscription_base` / `evaluate_delta_authority` / `delta_rejection_stream_disposition`.
- CP/DP version negotiation uses SemVer (`check_peer_version_compatibility`): empty/malformed rejected; major.minor must match; patch and prerelease/build differences allowed. CP admission returns `FailedPrecondition`; every ConfigUpdate envelope, including a heartbeat, must carry a compatible version.
- On fallback CP, DP races the stream against primary-retry timer `FERRUM_DP_CP_FAILOVER_PRIMARY_RETRY_SECS` between messages so in-flight applies are not cancelled mid-`spawn_blocking`.

## Dependency Version Sync

- `tests/performance/multi_protocol/` is a standalone crate with its own `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`.
- Protocol-level dependencies shared with the root crate must stay version-aligned. Cross-version wire incompatibilities can silently fail.
- When bumping shared deps in the root `Cargo.toml`, update `tests/performance/multi_protocol/Cargo.toml` and run `cd tests/performance/multi_protocol && cargo update -p <crate>`.
- Look for `# SYNC:` comments in both manifests.
